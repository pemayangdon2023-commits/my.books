         <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7;">
             Hello, My name is <strong>Pema Yangdon</strong>. I am someone who finds joy,
             comfort, and inspiration in books. Reading helps me explore new worlds,
             understand different perspectives, and grow as a person. I am currently studying in ninth grade and I am sixteen years old.
         </p>


         <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7;">
             I created this website because I wanted a meaningful space where I could share
             my thoughts on books, review my favorite stories, and inspire others to read.
             Books have always felt like home to me—calm, comforting, and full of discovery.
         </p>


         <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7;">
             Other than reading, I enjoy writing, learning new skills, and exploring
             nature. Every book I read teaches me something new and helps shape
             the person I want to become. Through this website, I hope to keep growing
             and share my reading journey with everyone.

     <h2 style="color:#bdbd16;">My interest in books</h2>


     <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7;">
         I have always been very interested in reading books. From the moment I discovered stories, I enjoyed exploring different worlds and learning about new things. Reading is not just a hobby for me; it is something that makes me happy and excited. I like reading books of many kinds, such as stories, novels, and even short articles. Each book teaches me something new and makes me curious to know more.
     </p>


     <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7;">
         Reading books has helped me improve my English a lot. When I read, I learn new words and understand how sentences are formed. It also helps me know how to express my thoughts better. Sometimes, I read stories more than once to understand them clearly, and this makes my vocabulary stronger. Reading regularly has made me more confident in speaking and writing English.
     </p>


     <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7;">
         Books have also taught me important lessons about life and people. Through reading, I can understand different feelings, ideas, and experiences. It is like traveling without leaving home. The more I read, the more I feel that my imagination grows, and my mind becomes sharper. Reading has truly been a big part of my life, and I want to continue learning through books every day.
